Week 02
-------

Today we looked at a range of typographic applications from environmental, to sculptural, analogue and digital.

We are still scoping project possibilities with research into typography explored on a number of avenues.

In addition to last weeks rerading list the following books may prove useful:

- [8 Faces](http://blog.8faces.com)
- [Just My Type](http://www.simongarfield.com/pages/books/just_my_type.htm)
- [Jan Tschichold's The New Typography](https://www.amazon.co.uk/New-Typography-Weimar-Now-Criticism/dp/0520250125/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1539091027&sr=8-1&keywords=the+new+typography) 

Looking at the written word, in particular the evolution of the printed book in context to their digital counterparts, the work of [Visual Editions](https://visual-editions.com) and [Editions at Play](https://visual-editions.com/editions-at-play-x-google-creative-lab) could be explored.
